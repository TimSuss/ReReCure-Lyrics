La la la the sun is shining bright
Dancing through the morning light
Words that flow like streams of sound
Echoes all around and around

Singing songs of joy and cheer
Music ringing loud and clear
Melodies that rise and fall
Harmonies that call to all

Rhythm moving through the air
Beating everywhere with care
Notes that climb the distant sky
Flying free and flying high

Voices blend in sweet refrain
Washing over like the rain
Chorus strong and verses long
This is just a simple song

Bridge that takes us somewhere new
Painting pictures red and blue
Back again to where we start
Music from the very heart

La la la the sun is bright
Dancing through the morning light
Words that flow like streams of sound
Echoes all around and around
