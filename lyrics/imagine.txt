Colors spinning all around
Making such a joyful sound
Rainbows painting in the sky
Watch the pretty clouds go by

Flowers blooming in the spring
Hear the little birdies sing
Butterflies with wings so bright
Dancing through the morning light

Oceans rolling to the shore
Never stopping, evermore
Waves that crash and waves that flow
Moving fast and moving slow

Thunder rumbles in the air
Lightning flashing everywhere
Storms that come and storms that go
Bringing rain and bringing snow

Sunshine breaking through the clouds
Singing happy songs out loud
Laughter echoing around
Feet that barely touch the ground

Colors spinning all around
Making such a joyful sound
Rainbows painting in the sky
Watch the pretty clouds go by

One more verse to end this tune
Underneath the silver moon
Stars are twinkling way up high
Saying goodnight to the sky
