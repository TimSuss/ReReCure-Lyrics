Walking down the winding road
Carrying a heavy load
Footsteps echo in the night
Searching for a guiding light

Mountains tall and valleys deep
Promises we try to keep
Rivers running to the sea
Flying wild and flying free

Stars above us shine so bright
Guiding travelers through the night
Moon is rising in the east
Dancing at the midnight feast

Whispers carried on the breeze
Rustling through the autumn trees
Shadows dancing on the wall
Rising up and then they fall

Time is fleeting like a dream
Nothing's ever as it seems
Moments passing one by one
Dancing circles round the sun

Walking down the winding road
Carrying a heavy load
Footsteps echo in the night
Searching for a guiding light
